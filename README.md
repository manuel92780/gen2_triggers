first pass of dom+event level triggers for use in gen2
this code contains functionality to run over mDOM, DEgg, pDOM

the cuts on charge are currently on reconstructed charge
this means that there are many events that contain less than 1 PE but greater than 0.25 PE
for baseline comparisons, use any event that has any reconstructed charge
